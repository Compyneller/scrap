        We Buy Your Recyclables! At Scrap Care India we believe in the Three
        R’s, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.Our firm believe is that in order to
        reduce the impact of our activities on the environment, we must start
        with reducing the amount of waste we produce by being more conscious
        about our buying habits and by limiting the use of paper and plastic
        products in our daily lives.The Scrap Care India process insures that
        all recyclables that are collected are first looked at carefully for the
        purpose of reuse rather than sending them for recycling.There are many
        items such as used furniture, clothes, cardboard boxes, and plastic that
        could be reused rather than sent for recycling.
        <br />
        <br />
        At Scrap Care India we reuse many of these items to make used furniture
        or sell them to operators of used goods stores. Only those items that
        are not of use to us are sent to an authorized recycling facility for
        the purpose of recycling.
