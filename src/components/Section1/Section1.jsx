        We cherish what we have and hold on to it even if we are not using it.
        It is equally important to understand what and how to yield more from
        your old items.Now, REUSE—is easier because Team Scrap Care India is
        proud to announce a change which can bring more transparency and options
        for the users. Our constant focus is on reduce, reuse and recycle
        motivates us to find the way of discovering, giving, swapping or selling
        pre-loved items online.
        <br />
        In our new move users can display/post pictures of their second hand
        products on our website. These items will immediately get a quote from
        us but if as a user you don’t like it then wait because now others are
        open to quote too. If buyers & sellers interact directly and wish to do
        transaction then they can do it. We can also facilitate the process by
        providing transportation facility and in some cases we can pay on their
        behalf and they can pay us at the time of delivery.
        <br />
        Scrap Care India inspires and rewards smarter, everyday choices for a
        more sustainable future.We know that it takes a group effort to make a
        positive impact, which is why we bring together communities, businesses
        and people like you.
        <br />
        Now, users will have more power and we also wish to make it a one stop
        shop for trading old items. As we learn to let go, we create space for
        more or make more.
